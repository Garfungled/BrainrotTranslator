This is a String Project for my AP Java class that I'm working on with a friend. Don't expect it to be amazing. Also this is for fun.

# TODO
- [X] Create a MVP (minimum viable product)
- [ ] Clean up code
- [ ] Add some sort of object oriented-ness
- [ ] Make a better string replace to avoid replacing words in other words, e.x. "bro" in "brought"
